        <description>The values from this codelist are used to identify the particular list that an organisation identifier was drawn from. The codelist provides a register of known identifier lists, including national company registers, NGO directories and international and multilateral organisation lists - along with guidance and online resources to help locate the identifiers assigned to a specific organisation.

As of 17 July 2017 this list is maintained by the org-id.guide project. Data publishers can now search for and locate the relevant list for a particular organisation identifier using the `org-id.guide website &lt;http://org-id.guide/&gt;`__. The full register of identifier sources is also available to download in `XML &lt;http://org-id.guide/download.xml&gt;`__, `JSON &lt;http://org-id.guide/download.json&gt;`__ and `CSV &lt;http://org-id.guide/download.csv&gt;`__ formats.

IATI periodically replicates the codelist of identifier sources from org-id.guide, to assist those accessing IATI documentation. However, it is advised that the most up-to-date source is the `org-id.guide project &lt;http://org-id.guide/&gt;`__.

If org-id.guide does not contain an entry for the kind of organisation you need to identify, you can make a request a new list is included in the register following the `guidance &lt;http://docs.org-id.guide/en/latest/contribute/&gt;`__ or by getting in touch with org-id.guide at: contact@org-id.guide.</description>
        <description xml:lang="fr">Les valeurs de cette liste d&#233;signent la liste sp&#233;cifique dont est issu un identifiant d'organisation. La liste de codes constitue un registre de listes connues d'identifiants, y compris des registres nationaux de compagnies, des r&#233;pertoires d'ONG et des listes d'organisations internationales et multilat&#233;rales - ainsi que des instructions et des ressources en ligne pour faciliter la recherche des identifiants assign&#233;s &#224; une organisation donn&#233;e.

Depuis le 17 juillet 2017 cette liste est g&#233;r&#233;e par le projet org-id.guide. Les diffuseurs de donn&#233;es peuvent maintenant utiliser le site web `org-id.guide &lt;http://org-id.guide/&gt;`__ pour trouver la liste pertinente pour un identifiant d&#8217;organisation donn&#233;.

L&#8217;IITA reproduit p&#233;riodiquement la liste de codes des sources d&#8217;identifiants depuis org-id.guide pour aider ceux qui utilisent la documentation de l&#8217;IITA. Veuillez cependant noter que la source la plus &#224; jour est le projet `org-id.guide project &lt;http://org-id.guide/&gt;`__.

Si org-id.guide n&#8217;offre pas de contenu pour le genre d&#8217;organisation que vous devez identifier, vous pouvez pr&#233;senter une requ&#234;te pour l&#8217;ajout d&#8217;une nouvelle liste au registre en suivant les indications `guidance &lt;http://docs.org-id.guide/en/latest/contribute/&gt;`__ ou en contactant org-id.guide &#224; contact@org-id.guide.</description>

            <description>The Afghan Central Business Registry is a service which allows a single place to register a business in Afghanistan. All companies, groups and individuals are required to register at the ACBR, where they receive confirmation of their registration, become published in the ACBR Gazette and receive the Tax Identification Number. 

"The new Central Registry is a one stop shop to register your business. It brings together all of the functions previously done by the commercial courts, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Finance." [1]

"ACBR exists to provide services to businesses in Afghanistan intending to register their names and protect their intellectual property rights." [2]

"All corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies and sole proprietorships doing Trade are required to register with ACBR, which facilitates the registration process, including assistance for completing the application form, paying fees, publishing key business information in the Official Gazette and reporting specification of businesses to the Revenue Department of MoF. Registration is required only one time unless a business makes major changes (i.e., change in ownership, executive management, or location or if the initial capital increases or decreases).

Businesses are referred to ACBR from either the Trader License office located in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, from AISA, or from any other license departments after they acquire a business license." [3]

Clearing houses commissioned by the Federal Ministry of Justice (Die &#214;sterreichische Justiz) provide the only access to the database.[2] Interfaces are mostly available only in German, and access/fees vary between the different operators.

Consider using the Business Register number with the prefix AT-FB (see list AT-FB) - which is a primary rather than secondary list - instead of the VAT number.

"ABN registration details become part of the Australian Business Register (ABR)"

Each ABN should equate to a single 'business structure', although that structure may be used to carry out a range of business activities.  A range of kinds of entity are issued ABNs, including individuals, corporations, partnerships, unincorporated associations, trusts and superannuation funds. Entities must be carrying on a business in or connection to Australia to receive an ABN.

Charities are issued ABNs when they are formed. See: https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/charities.</description>

"Its prime objective is to provide one-stop service to the NGOs operating with foreign assistance and registered under the Foreign Donations (Voluntary Activities) Regulation Ordinance, 1978. In addition, it facilitates the activities of the NGOs in the country, and ensures their accountability to the state and thereby to the people of the country" [1]

"Bureau approves the project proposals submitted by NGOs" [2]

"NGOs much certify in the project proposal that they receive foreign donation or contribution from legal sources." [3]

"Bureau has the responsibility to make sure that money being channelized by NGOs is from legal sources. Bureau also realizes government revenue-both tax (income tax, VAT etc) and non-tax (registration fee). Bureau always coordinates with NGOs, line ministries, different state agencies and development partners in discharging its duty as the regulatory authority. Here the spirit is to facilitate the NGO activities, not to regulate them" [4]

b) or must register in fulfillment of an obligation imposed by legislation Belgium other than that covered by this Act;
5. associations without legal personality must be registered pursuant to an obligation imposed by Belgian legislation other than that covered by this Act;
6. the establishment of units of the above mentioned companies." [3]

"The Crossroads Bank for Enterprises (BCE) is a register of the Ministry of Economy which includes all the companies basic identification data and their business units. The ECB's management department is responsible for recording, backup, manage and make available data from the ECB. The ECB is one of the authority for initiatives, application of the principle of single data collection, to simplify administrative procedures for businesses and improve the efficiency of public services." [1]

            <description>Any individual, company, cooperative, non-profit association, non-governmental organisation or international organisation starting a commercial activity in Burundi must register with the Office Burundais des Recettes (OBR) and receive a Tax Identification Number (Numero d&#8217;Identification Fiscale) [1]. There is a publicly available site to verify the ownership and validity of the Tax Identification Numbers. The search is done using the NIF number and the result returns plain text stating who the NIF belongs to and whether the number is recognised by the OBR.

            <name>Unique Tax Identifier</name>
            <description>The Benin 'Unique Fiscal Identifier' was created by Decree No 2006-201 of 8 May 2006, and is linked to a national directory of persons, institutions and associations.

"The IFU's main objective is:

* To uniquely register natural or legal persons throughout the national territory;
* To avoid assigning several identifiers (INSAE number, taxpayer number, declaring code, etc.) to the same person;
* Consolidate and secure information about any identified person;
* To establish a reliable database for information, cross-checking and management purposes;
* Improve and modernize the management of public finances with the introduction of a development tax system;"[1]

Identifiers are assigned to: "

* Enterprises engaged in commercial or non-commercial activity in the territory of Benin, regardless of their form, legal status or nationality;
* Employees in the public or private sector;
* Corporate officers;
* Embassies, international organizations and non-governmental organizations;
* Landowners;
* Individuals over eighteen (18) years of age engaged in self-employed or non-commercial activities;
* Central government, public institutions and local authorities;
* Trade unions and political parties, any natural or legal person governed by private law"[1].

An IFU is 13 characters long. The first digit indicate the type of entity identified:

* 1- Individual / male 
* 2- Individual / female 
* 3- Legal entity / company 
* 4- Legal person / state structure 
* 5- Legal person / international organization and mission diplomatic 
* 6- Legal person / non-governmental organization

The subsequent 4 digits give the year. 

The next six digits are a unique identifier within that year.

The next digit indicates either (1) a parent company; (2-9) subsidiary or agencies; (0) other types of person or taxpayer.

The final digit is a checksum.

Organizations register exclusively on the Federal Revenue website. After filling in the necessary data online, relevant documents are sent by mail or presented in person.
The CNPJ Registration Number is a fourteen digit number that must be included on all receipts and invoices. Tax authorities assign an eight-digit company registration number that makes up the first part of the CNPJ. The following four digits refer to the business place or branch. Company headquarters are usually assigned the number 0001 for this section of the identification number, with other branches receiving different numbers. The final two numbers are check digits.</description>

            <description>Companies in Canada register with their provincial authority, e.g. British Columbia, and then they register with the Canadian Revenue Agency in order to pay corporate income tax and receive a Business Number.

The code CA-CRA_ACR is used for Canadian Business Numbers. 

Non-profits and other kinds of legal entities may also have a Canadian Business Number. 

The business number is sometimes reported with a Program Account code (e.g. RP0001 to indicate a payroll program account, leading a number such as 123456789RP0001). In constructing an organisation identifier, only the first nine digits should be used. 

Companies can be searched by using the Business Number, as assigned by the CRA, on this incomplete registry hosted by the Canadian govt - https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpSrch.html?locale=en_CA

## More detail:

Not all companies need a Canadian Business Number. Detailed information can be found here - http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/bn-ne/wrks-eng.html

Not all charities need to register with the Canadian Revenue Agency. Detailed information can be found here - http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/chrts/pplyng/rgstrtn/mnd-eng.html

Not all non-profit organisations must register to become a charity. Detailed information can be found here - http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/chrts-gvng/dnrs/rgltn/dffrnc-rc-np-eng.html

            <description>The Swiss Commercial Register is administered by the cantons under the supervision of the Swiss Confederation. All the commercial register entries made by the cantonal register offices are published in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce (SOGC) after having been checked and approved by the Federal Commercial Registry Office.

Since January 2011, all companies, foreign branches and associations / foundations registered in the various Swiss Commerce Registries are assigned a unique federal Company Identification Number, locally known as IDE (French), UID (German), IDI (Italian). 

Previously, identifiers were of the format CH-RRR.X.XXX.XXX-P, where RRR is the canton number, X.XXX.XXX is the company number, and P is a check-digit. Some older or inactive companies may still have identifiers of this form.

            <description>The SAIC is the national body which ensures business rights in China, for both domestic and foreign enterprises. Businesses must register with the SAIC. The Enterprise Registration Bureau is the department responsible for enterprise registration.

For further details on the procedure for starting a business entity, see this WikiProcedure - https://www.wikiprocedure.com/index.php/China_-_Start_a_Business_Entity

The database is only available in Chinese language

"The State Administration for Industry &amp; Commerce (SAIC) of the People&#8217;s Republic of China is the competent authority of ministerial level directly under the State Council in charge of market supervision/regulation and related law enforcement through administrative means.

With creating a regulated and harmonized market environment of fairness, justice and faithfulness for the coordinated socioeconomic development as its objective, SAIC functions in maintaining market order and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of businesses and consumers by carrying out regulations in the fields of enterprise registration, competition, consumer protection, trademark protection and combating economic illegalities." [1] 

"Our responsibilities:
2.     Carry out and administer registration of enterprises (including foreign-invested enterprises), agricultural cooperatives, entities or individuals engaged in business operation and resident representative offices of foreign companies; and take charge of the investigation and ban on unlicensed business operation according to law." [2]

"Enterprise Registration Bureau
-        Draft measures and practice directions regarding enterprise registration;
-        Coordinate and guide enterprise registration nationwide; 
-        Take charge of registration of certain enterprises and supervises the registrants&#8217; registration practices; 
-        Organize and guide credit rating of businesses; 
-        Establish and maintain the national database of enterprise registration information, and analyze and publish registration information of domestic enterprises." [3]

There is also a website for businesses (http://gsxt.gov.cn) but you will need to know the organisation&#8217;s name in Chinese to find the USCI. NGOs and businesses should be able to provide their USCI easily. NGOs have to have their registration checked and reconfirmed every year in accordance with the Overseas NGO Management Law which came into effect in January 2017.</description>

            <description>A VAT registration number (DI&#268;) is a unique and unambiguous identification of each tax entity, a legal or natural person who is a taxpayer (taxpayer). The tax identification number is assigned only after the entity, natural or legal person, obtains its I&#268;O - its unique identification number. Note that the list [CZ-ICO](/list/CZ-ICO) might therefore provide a better set of identifiers for legal entities.

You can search by VAT (DI&#268;) number for a of the VAT payer registered in the Czech Republic. You can also use your company ID or company name or your business name and surname if you want to verify your VAT payer details.</description>

            <name>Access to Registers of Economic Subjects </name>
            <description>The ARES is an information system which collates data from several public registers in the Czech Republic. These include:

Public registers comprising: the Commercial Register Federal Register, the Register of Foundations Register&#8217;s Institute, Register of Public Service Companies, Trade Register, and the Register of Economic Entities.

Enterprises do not register with the ARES. They must be register with the relevant registration authority. 

"The purpose of the ARES web sites of the Ministry of Finance is to provide a single-point access to all data concerning economic entities kept in particular registers or maintained in files of the state administration. ARES provides an easy access to the data transferred from the source registers to the ARES database. It allows also to switch directly to www applications of the state administration bodies provided that such applications already exist." [1]

"It is not possible to make a registration in the Information System ARES directly. It is necessary to proceed in accordance with applicable laws and to make a registration at the registration points of the public administration authorities. Likewise, data changes or termination of the registration must be reported to the institution that maintains the source registry. List of source registers and responsible institutions is presented in the tab REGISTRATION AUTHORITIES." [2]

 Information on companies is searchable in English and is free-of-charge.

            <description>Companies, partnerships and co-operatives are registered in Germany at the level of local courts. Each court issues it's own registration numbers, so registration number 0001 from one court is not the same organisation as registration number 0001 from a different court.

The Common Register Portal of the German Federal States allows a search across all the court records. 

To distinguish between the identifiers from different courts, the individual 'Registration Agency' identifier from each court, from the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation's [Registration Authorities list](https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/code-lists/gleif-registration-authorities-list) should be used, giving identifiers of the form:

            <description>All business operating in Finland must obtain a Business ID ("Y-tunnus" in Finnish) from the Finnish Trade Register. The Finnish Trade Register is maintained by the Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH), which is also responsible for maintaining the Business Information System, which can be used to search for all companies in Finland, and the API which allows users to download company information in bulk. 

"The Finnish Trade Register (Finnish: Kaupparekisteri, Swedish: Handelsregistret) is a company register in Finland. It provides official information on businesses in the whole country, including data from current and old register entries, articles of association, partnership agreements or rules." [1]

"The Finnish Trade Register is a public register that contains information about businesses and companies. As a rule, all businesses have to be registered at the Trade Register. Businesses also have to notify the register of any changes in their registered details. Most businesses must also submit their financial statements (annual accounts) to the register. " [2] 

"The Business Information System BIS ("YTJ" in Finnish) is a service jointly maintained by the Finnish Patent and Registration Office and the Finnish Tax Administration, enabling you to file information to both authorities using one single notification. 

You can use the BIS to:

start a business or an organization
report changes 
close down a business or an organization
search for basic details of companies and organizations using the company search" [3]

            <description>The Finnish Tax Administration (Finnish: Verohallinto, Swedish: Skattef&#246;rvaltningen) maintains the register of Finnish companies registered to pay Value Added Tax (VAT). 

&#8220;A company selling goods or services in the conduct of business is usually liable to pay VAT and has to be entered in the VAT register. In some cases, for example if the company&#8217;s turnover is small, VAT registration is voluntary. In addition, some operations are exempt from VAT. A company conducting VAT-exempt operations cannot be entered in the VAT register.&#8221; [1]

&#8220;VAT number is &#8217;ALV-numero&#8217; in Finnish and &#8217;momsnummer&#8217; or &#8216;merv&#228;rdesskattenummer&#8217; in Swedish.&#8221;  [2]

            <name>Trade and Companies Register </name>
            <description>In France, companies register through a number of institutions, predominantly the local centres de formalit&#233;s des entreprises, but all companies must eventually be registered with the Trade and Companies Register. Once registered, companies receive a SIREN or SIRET number, which is a unique business identifier.

This information is maintained by Infogreffe. Infogreffe provide a basic overview of company information for free, and bulk download of data for a fee.

A note on identifiers: 

- A SIRET number is constituted by the SIREN number, plus the NIC code. 

- The SIREN number relates to a business, whereas a SIRET number relates to a specific geographically located establishment which will be owned by a business.

- "A SIREN number is your unique French business identification number. This 9 digit number will be requested by all French administration when dealing with you.. It is a proof that you are a fully registered French business" [1]

"The SIRET code/number is an INSEE code which allows the geographic identification of any French establishment or business.

The 14-digit number consists of three parts:

- first, the SIREN code of the business (or legal unit or person) that owns the unit represented by the SIRET code,
- second, the NIC (French: Num&#233;ro interne de classement), is a sequential four-digit number unique to the establishment,
- and finally, a check digit that verifies the entire SIRET number.

For example, 732 829 320 00074 would refer to the seventh establishment of the business with SIREN number 732 829 320." [2]

"Registration is administered by local centres de formalit&#233;s des entreprises ( CFE), which checks your application and submits details to the relevant agencies (for a small fee). The CFE will provide you with a form M0, which is for the creation of a company." [3] 

"Creating a company requires that it is registered with the Trade and Companies Register (RCS)." [4] 

"WHAT SOURCE IS USED FOR INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE INFOGREFFE WEBSITE?

Information concerning companies entered on the Trade and Companies Register with Registries of the Commercial Courts is taken directly from public registers held by said registries. 

Information concerning companies entered on the Trade and Companies Register with other jurisdictions (district courts with commercial jurisdiction, mixed commercial courts in the overseas departments and territories) is provided by the National Industrial Property Institute (INPI).

Information concerning companies not entered on the Trade and Companies Register is taken from data on the SIRENE listing held by INSEE." [5]

            <description>Church Codes are a unique identification number supplied to each church building by the Church of England Central Services, which is part of the administrative bodies of the National Church Institutions that work together to support the mission and ministries of the Church of England. This code provides a unique number for the property assets of the Church of England.

The codes are used to represent the church as an entity as well as everything connected to it such as financial and congregational records.

The churches are owned locally, held in trust by the incumbent of the church (priest) and the management is run by a committee, a Parochial Church Council (PCC). These organisations are often not registered for a GB-CHC number due their income being less than &#163;100,000 number despite being otherwise regulated by the Charity Commission. They are also excluded from the UK Register of Trusts. For this reason, these church codes may be used to identified PCCs.</description>

This internal higher education provider ID is given in the INSTID field. (Higher education providers submit their UK Provider Reference Number (UKPRN) as part of the data submission process to HESA.

The system assigns an identifier to each registered organisation, and may record details of other identifiers for the organisation, such as a DUNS number.

Crown Commercial Service (part of the Cabinet Office) publishes a list of the identifiers for all organisations that are registered in the system as **buyers**. Whilst primarily covering government agencies from all levels of government, the list also includes some private companies, trusts and charities who have been assigned the buyer role within the system.

The use of Supplier Registration System identifiers is considered a temporary measure. They should only be used when no other stable identifier for a government agency is available, and should not be used to identify private organisations, for which company registration numbers are preferred. </description>

The Register of Schools is maintained by the Department of Education which provides a School number as the unique identifier for each school or other educational establishment in Wales.

Universities are not registered through this registrar. Welsh schools used to be registered by the Department of Education for England and Wales and, although it is not the registrar, the English Department of Education still held records for Welsh schools as of October 2019. Use this list in preference over the English one for Welsh schools.</description>

            <description>All companies in Guernsey must register with the Guernsey Registry. This also applies to most charities and NPOs. The Guernsey Registry maintain a registry of all companies, charities and all NPOs in Guernsey. These are recorded in a publicly searchable webpage database for companies and also two separate lists for charities and NPOs.

Please Note: According to OpenCorporates, the identifiers are not unique across the Guernsey Registry, as there a five separate registries that can be assigned to organisation information and up to five companies my have the same identifier. OC have thus added their own identifier number based on each registry type. Further details available here - qa_public/register_problems/guernsey

"All Guernsey companies must file an Annual Validation submission with the Registry during January 2017 (unless incorporated in December 2016). Submissions received after 31 January 2017 will be subject to a &#163;100 late filing fee." [1]

"The Charities and Non Profit Organisation (Registration) (Guernsey) Law, 2008 requires all Non Profit organisations based in the Islands of Guernsey, Alderney, Herm and Jethou to register with the Office of the Registrar. A failure to do so is an offence.

However there is an exemption from this requirement. This applies to Non Profit organisations based in the Islands of Guernsey, Alderney, Herm and Jethou with gross assets and funds of less than &#163;10,000, or gross annual income of less than &#163;5,000." [2]

**More information**

"The Registrar of Companies (ROC) is an office under the Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs that deals with administration of the Companies Act 1956 and Companies Act, 2013. There are currently 22 Registrars of Companies (ROC) operating from offices in all major states of India. Some states, such as Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, have two ROCs each. Section 609 of the Companies Act, 1956 tasks the ROCs with the primary duty of registering companies and LLPs floated in the respective states and the union territories under their administration.

The Registrar of Company takes care of company registration (also known as incorporation) in India, completes reporting and regulation of companies and their directors and shareholders, and also oversees government reporting of various matters including the annual filling of various documents."

            <description>Companies and Non Profit Organisations operating in Jersey register with the Financial Services Commission (JFSC). A search of company information is freely available on the Commission website. There was no search available for NPOs at the time of last checks.

Users should be aware that the identifier numbers are not unique, as there are multiple types of companies and identifiers can be repeated. For example, there are two companies with the number '1381' - an LP (limited partnership) and an RC (Registered Private Company)

It is recommended that those creating identifiers for JSFC use the business codes as part of the identifier. For example, the limited partnership company described above should have the identifier:

JE-FSC-LP_1381


"The Non-Profit Organizations (Jersey) Law 2008 (the &#8220;NPO Law&#8221;) was registered by the Royal Court on 25 July 2008 and came into effect on 8 August 2008.  This legislation requires NPOs to register with the Commission in certain circumstances.  The definition of an NPO, as provided by Article 1 of the NPO Law, is given below:

&#8220;An organization is a non-profit organization for the purposes of this Law if &#8211; 
(a) it is established solely or primarily for charitable, religious, cultural, educational, social,
    or fraternal purposes with the intention of benefiting the public or a section of the public; and
(b) it raises or disburses funds in pursuance of those purposes.&#8221; " [1]

"The Board has the responsibility of regulating and enabling the NGO sector in Kenya.

Our Mandate:

To maintain the register of National and International NGOs operating in Kenya, with the precise sectors, affiliations and locations of their activities." [1]

"Under section 31 of the NGOs Regulations 1992, any member of the public is allowed to inspect the files and the documents therein of any registered organization during normal working hours. They can also obtain copies of documents in the files.

To conduct a records search a letter should be written to the ED of the NGOB stating the name of the applicant as well as the organization whose details they wish to search and the information they seek.

The applicant can decide whether to carry out the records search themselves or have the Board conduct it on their behalf. This will be upon a requisite payment of Kenya Shillings Three Thousand (KES 3000)" [2]

            <description>A foreign NGO must register with the MOFA by entering into a Memorandum of Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) with MOFA. After the MOFA has entered into the MOU with a foreign NGO, the NGO must sign a Project Agreement with the MOFA before starting its work.  A foreign NGO may be established for a three (3) year duration which must be renewed with the MOFA before the expiration of the term.
An organization registered as a foreign NGO by the MOFA is considered properly licensed to carry out its activities in Cambodia and no further registration is required. However, in the event a foreign organization was to carry out business activities pursuant to Article 272 of the LOCE it may remain subject to registration as in accordance with that provision.
After obtaining MOFA or MOI approval to be established, a foreign or local NGO must also register with the CDC if it wishes to import duty free materials to serve its program. The CDC will periodically require the NGO complete several forms.</description>

            <description>The Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register (Registre de commerce et des soci&#233;t&#233;s &#8211; RCS) is a public register and can be freely accessed. It contains information about traders and companies which, by law, must be disclosed and published, alongside their RCS number. This information is published on the RESA publication platform (https://www.lbr.lu/mjrcs-resa/). The RCS is managed by the Luxembourg Business Registers (LBR) (https://www.lbr.lu/).

The information that is published serves to identify the trader or company, and includes particulars such as a company's articles of association, its rules of procedure, the liability of its directors and officers, and the company accounts.

The information that the trader/company will be required to disclose for publication depends on the legal form of the business, its size and its sector of activity.

All companies that are newly incorporated in Luxembourg must be registered with the RCS, and their articles of association must be filed with the latter in full or in extract form depending of the legal form of the business.

Subsequent amendments to published information must also be published.

The LBR ensures interoperability between the Luxembourg RCS and the business registers of other EU member states through the Business Registers Interconnection System.</description>

Registration follows the establishment of the entity and this being recognised by publication of its new status in the Journal de Monaco [2]. Sole traders (Personne Physique) are also registered and issued RCI numbers, as are some foreign commercial establishments [3].

Data from the State Chamber of Registration is published once per month on the Government Portal of Open Data (http://www.date.gov.md/en) and can be searched in a convenient way via dedicated platform http://www.idno.md/."[1]

The unique state identification number (IDNO) assigned to the legal entity also constitutes its fiscal code.

"The idno.md platform has been developed to facilitate access to open government data and to help citizens gain added value by using them. The project is based on the reuse of public data about registered companies in the Republic of Moldova, presenting them in a user-friendly way so that everyone can easily analyze and process them.

The platform allows users to search through data, track company history, and generate infotainment based on available data. At present, information is available about over 215,000 companies that have been registered in Moldova since 1991.

The data on idno.md is updated monthly, automatically. The idno.md team has long envisioned to integrate other information that will be available to the public, including information on public procurement connected with companies that have won tenders over the years."[1]

More information about companies and their administrators / founders can be requested at the State Registration Chamber.

            <description>The Tax Identification Number (TIN) is a unique number given to Individuals, Limited Liability Companies, Incorporated Trustees, Enterprises, Cooperative Society, MDAs, Trade Association etc. for the purpose of tax payment [1]. The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) is the agency responsible for providing the Tax Identification Number (TIN)[2].

There is a publicly available site to verify the ownership and validity of the Tax Identification Numbers [3]. The search is done using the TIN number and the result returns plain text stating who the TIN belongs to.

            <description>All companies and entities (including most NGOs) in the Netherlands must enrol with the Commercial Register, which is hosted by the Dutch Chamber of Commerce. Each entity receives a Chamber of Commerce (KVK) number upon registration.

Basic company information is available for free and more detailed information, such as a Business Register extract or financial statements, can be downloaded for a fee. [1]

According to the Chamber of Commerce, you have a business when you supply goods or services, you demand more than symbolic payment for these, and you take part in regular commercial transactions [2]. NGOs must register as a foundation [3].

            <description>Overheid.nl is the central access point to all information about government organisations of the Netherlands.

The Overheid.nl Web Metadata Standard ( OWMS ) is the metadata standard for information from the Dutch government on the Internet.

It contains URIs for a wide range of government bodies, including national, local and regional government and water boards.

It provides a linked open dataset which contains ontological information about the relationship between those organisations (e.g. listing parent agencies, or noting organisations that succeed previous organisations).

A management plan is in place for updating of the information [1].

            <description>Companies in Norway must be Registered with the Register of Business Enterprises. Non-profits are eligible for registry with the Register of Non-Profit Organizations. 

These registries are maintained by the Br&#248;nn&#248;ysundregistrene.  Businesses can be incorporated by applying to the online 'coordinated register notification' - Altinn, which is also maintained by Br&#248;nn&#248;ysundregistrene.  

This database can be searched by the public for free from the organisation homepage, and can be downloaded in various data format.

"The Register of Business Enterprises registers all Norwegian and foreign businesses in Norway, ensuring legal protection and financial overview." [1] 

"Non-profit organizations that run voluntary activities not motivated by profit are eligible to register. Examples of such organizations are:

- associations
- non-commercial foundations that do not distribute funds, or that only - distribute funds to non-profit activities
- commercial foundations that only distribute funds to non-profit activities
- limited liability companies that only distribute funds to non-profit activities." [2]

            <description>The Inland Revenue Department is responsible for the administration of Value Added Tax, Income Tax, and Excise Duty. In the performance of these duties it maintains a register of Permanent Account Numbers (PANs) the unique taxpayer identification number for Nepal.

This register covers individuals as well as legal entities. Org-id does not recommend using the PAN of an individual person as a unique identifier.

The PAN is described as follows[1]:

PAN is a unique identification number, which is issued to all the taxpayers and Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) withholding agents throughout the kingdom. PAN identifies each taxpayer or TDS withholding agent uniquely countrywide.
PAN is necessary to process taxpayers or TDS withholding agents using computer systems.
PAN is allotted only once in the lifetime of a taxpayer or TDS withholding agent. It never changes.

            <description>International NGOs wishing to operate in Nepal must register with the Social Welfare Council. Upon registration, these INGOs receive an Affiliation Certificate and an SWC Affiliation Number. This database can be searched on the website.

Local NGOs do not need to be associated with the SWC, but may register with their local District Administration Office (DAO). The SWC list is thus not a complete list of all NGOs working in Nepal.

"1. As laid down in article 12, Section 1, of the Social Welfare Act 2049, the international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) seeking to work in the Kingdom of Nepal must apply to the Social Welfare Council and seek permission prior to starting work." [1]

            <description>The Pakistan Centre for Philanthropy provides certification for NGOs working in Pakistan. Registration with the PCP is not obligatory for working in Pakistan and therefore not all NGOs will be recorded on the 'PCP Certified CSO List'. However, this list can be searched online.

All NGOs are required to register with their local Voluntary Social Welfare department. 

"This voluntary assessment aims to enhance a CSOs' credibility and resultantly its access to funding. Through the allied activities of this programme, PCP promotes certified CSOs in an annual directory and on its website and also builds capacities of civil society organisations for greater effectiveness."

            <description>All NGOs are required to register with their local Voluntary Social Welfare (VSWA) department. The VSWA assigns each organisation with an organisation identifier that is made up of a number and the year of registration. There is no searchable database.

The VSWA number should be used as a unique identifier, but users should be aware that the entire sequence is needed (number and year), as it is possible that the number is unique to the year of registration, but is repeated for other years, i.e, 511-2007 is ASFP, but there may be another org with 511-1998.

"Any person intending to establish an agency, and any person
intending that an agency already in existence should be
continued as such, shall, in the prescribed form, and on payment
of the prescribed fee, make an application to the Registration
Authority" [1] 

"9.Registration, professional guidance and financial assistance to voluntary Social Welfare agencies for strengthening, improving and promoting their activities, coordination amongst NGOs / Donors and concerned government departments." [2]

Every organization receives REGON number during the registration phase.

Looking at REGON/NIP relations: most often all organizations having NIP (PL-NIP) will have REGON (PL-REGON) and vice-versa. 

One of a few exceptions are, for example, schools that will have REGON numbers (for statistical purposes), but they are not required to have NIP tax id number (because they are executing municipalities' budgets).</description>

From the National Budget Law (Presupuesto General de la Naci&#243;n (PGN)) of 2016 from Paraguay:

&#8220;The objective of the classification by entities is to organize information related income, spending and budgetary credits from the different state organisms and entities at various institutional levels according to their functions, nature, characteristics and dependencies.&#8221;[1]

The list is yearly updated given each the yearly national budget law.

N.B. Please note, many government organisations also have an 'RUC' code (list [PY-RUC](/list/PY-RUC)), which is preferred to this list.

            <name>Rwanda Governance Board</name>
            <description>Rwanda Governance Board registers and grants legal personality to national non-governmental organisations and religious based organisations. [1]

National non-governmental organisations are classified into three categories [2]:

* Public interest organisations
* Common interest organisations
* Foundations

Common interest organisations and foundations may operate for up to two years before registering with Rwanda Governance Board. [2]

Organisations registering with Rwanda Governance Board are issued a temporary operational certificate of registration, valid for a period 12 months, and must apply for legal personality within 9 months from the issue of the temporary certificate [2].

Decisions to grant legal personality to national non-governmental organisations are published in the [Official Gazette of the Republic of Rwanda](http://primature.gov.rw/media-publication/publication/latest-offical-gazettes.html). [2]

Based on examples from the Official Gazette the final four digits of the identifier represent either the year of issue of the temporary certificate or the year legal personality was granted and the preceding 3 characters identify the type of organisation as follows [3]:

* NGO for non-governmental organisatios
* RBO for religious based organisations

            <description>The Rwanda Revenue Authority issues Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN) for all physical and moral persons (people and companies/legal entities) undertaking taxable activities:

"This is a unique number which is issued to a taxpayer by the tax Administration. It is obligatory for every taxpayer to have this unique number. Taxpayers have the obligation to indicate this number on all correspondences they do with RRA. This number has to be indicated on all documents which the taxpayer provides to the tax administration as proof."

A TIN is issued after the person or entity submits the required papers to the Revenue Authority. Note that from Feb 2015, no RRA TIN certificate is issued to newly registered companies. Instead, a TIN is issued at the point of company registration with the Rwanda Development Board (https://org.rdb.rw/busregonline) and the registration certificate contains the TIN.

Most companies and associations have their organization number from the Swedish Companies Registration Office [Bolagsverket](http://www.bolagsverket.se). But also, for example, the Swedish Tax Agency and Land Survey allocate organizational numbers.

From the Swedish Companies Registration Office, the company or association has its organization number when we have decided to register. The organization number is on the registration certificate that we send out."[1]

"The first digit of the organization number is called "Group Number" and specifies the company form or other legal form to which the legal entity is grouped. The following group numbers may occur.

1 - Death certificate
2 - State, county council, municipalities, parishes
3 - Foreign companies engaged in business activities or own real estate in Sweden
5 - Aktiebolag
6 - Single company
7 - Economic associations , tenant-owner associations
8 - Ideal associations and foundations
9 - Trading companies , limited companies and simple companies"[2]

            <description>This Ministry covers the registration and operation of non-governmental, independent and not-for-profit organizations within Somaliland (Local, National and International NGOs). Registrations have to be regularly renewed. International NGOs can register or renew their certificates at https://mopnd.govsomaliland.org/articles/new-registration and local NGOs at https://mopnd.govsomaliland.org/articles/new-registration-2.

Local NGOs will be assigned with an identifier after registering. International NGOs should provide a copy of their home-country registration details.

The list does not include any regulation for the activities of UN organizations, Professional Associations, Private Companies, Industrial and Employee Associations, or those not relating to humanitarian activities.

The General Register for Non-Governmental Organizations records and maintains all information and data relating to NGOs. It has separate registration sections for National, International, Foreign, and Umbrellas NGOs.

An NGO is entered into the General Register using the official name of the NGO and the date of registration, serial number and registration number of the certificate.</description>

The procedure is here: http://www.rd.go.th/publish/21987.0.html The government site still mentions a 10-digit number but the law changed in 2012 and the TIN is now 13 digits long (see: https://msnagroup.com/new-thai-tax-id-number).

            <description>The Business Registrations and Licensing Agency (BRELA)[ (http://www.brela.go.tz/] registers companies in Tanzania. Based on the data available on Open Corporates, it appears that BRELA assigns each organisation with a unique identifier .

"The Business Registrations and Licensing Agency (BRELA) is an Executive Agency under the Ministry of Industry and Trade responsible for business administration and regulation of the laws; namely Companies Registration, Business Names Registration, Trade and Service Marks Registration, granting of Patents and issuing of Industrial License." [1] 

The Business Registrations and Licencing Agency (BRELA) has started to list registered companies in Tanzania through the Online Registration System (ORS) which can be searched for business and company names by the general public. Please note, however, that not all businesses may yet be present on the ORS as updated data or annual returns are required in order to populate the database.[2]

* National NGOs, which are established via registration with the Board
* International NGOS, which are established outside Tanzania but must register with the Board to operate in the country

NGOs must submit an application for registration to the public officer appointed by the Board at either district, regional or national level depending on the scope of their activities [1], [2], [3]. Successful applicants will be issued with a certificate of registration as evidence of authority to operate as an NGO [1].

In carrying out its statutory functions, TRA is regulated by law, and is responsible for administering impartially various taxes of the Central Government."[1]

The Tanzanian Revenue Authority provides Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN) for organisations registered in Tanzania. This is issued under section 3A(4) of the Income Tax Act no. 33 of 1973. As amended by the financial laws (miscellaneous amendments) 2000.

There is no searchable database for TIN. It's possible that a company with a TIN could be on the Tanzanian Business Registrations and Licensing Agency (BRELA) Online Registration System, which can be searched free of charge. It is worth checking list TZ-BRLA before deciding to use this list.

            <name>Employer Identification Number - Internal Revenue Service</name>
            <description>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assigns companies an Employer Identification Number (EIN) upon application. However, not all corporate entities are required to have an EIN. For tax-exempt entities (non-profits, charities etc.) the IRS maintains a list of EINs. Public listed company EINs are available via the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

Other EINs may be available by asking the organisation concerned, and are sometimes published on their websites.

"An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, and is used to identify a business entity. Generally, businesses need an EIN. " [1]

"An employer identification number (EIN), also called a tax ID number or taxpayer ID, is required for most business entities... A tax ID number is not required if you operate a sole proprietorship or an LLC with no employees, in which case you would simply use your own Social Security Number as a tax ID." [2]

In the US, corporate registration happens at the state level. The timeliness, availability, and licensing of this data varies among all 50 states. There is no federal dataset that contains all corporate registrations.

Across the states, performance varies widely and in many cases data is not available in bulk, is not machine readable, is not openly licensed etc. For more detail, see the per state summary on Open Corporates. 

"The Employer Identification Number (EIN), also known as the Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number, is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. When the number is used for identification rather than employment tax reporting, it is usually referred to as a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and when used for the purposes of reporting employment taxes, it is usually referred to as an EIN."

            <description>The System for Award Management (SAM) of U.S. General Services Administration (GSA). The System for Award Management website (SAM.gov) is an official website of the U.S. Government that allows users to register to do business with the U.S. Government.
SAM.gov issues entities with a Unique Entity ID (UEI) which is used across the federal government when they apply for federal awards as a prime awardee. Previously a D-U-N-S Number was used.
Entities must re-register annually. If registration lapses it is still possible to re-register. In all cases the UEI is persistent and is retained by the entity. 
To apply for federal funds, and to use other functionality such as full search, requires a login through the US government's Login.gov service. https://www.login.gov/policy/rules-of-use/ states that The Login.gov service is operated within the United States, but is accessible globally for public use.</description>

            <description>The D-U-N-S Number is a unique nine-digit number that identifies organizations on a location-specific basis. Companies, charities, and government agencies can all receive a D-U-N-S Number [1][2].

Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) assigns and maintains D-U-N-S Numbers. The process for requesting a D-U-N-S Number varies by country, but organizations can typically request a D-U-N-S Number via the D&amp;B website for their country. In the UK and Ireland, all registered businesses are automatically issued with a D-U-N-S Number [3][4].

D-U-N-S Numbers are location-specific so one legal entity may have many associated D-U-N-S Numbers, one for each business location [2].

"If a bona fide organisation is not registered with any recognised or appropriate registration agency (http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/OrganisationRegistrationAgency/) they should contact the IATI Technical Team who will exceptionally allocate an organisation identifier using the XI-IATI prefix.

While some of these identifiers have been derived from DAC codes, this &#8216;meaning&#8217; is not carried forward. i.e. IATI generated identifiers have no intrinsic meaning.

            <description>Maintained by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, the Index contains current and historical Legal Entity Identifier records.

"The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a 20-character, alpha-numeric code based on the ISO 17442 standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It connects to key reference information that enables clear and unique identification of legal entities participating in financial transactions. Each LEI contains information about an entity&#8217;s ownership structure and thus answers the questions of 'who is who&#8217; and &#8216;who owns whom&#8217;. Simply put, the publicly available LEI data pool can be regarded as a global directory, which greatly enhances transparency in the global marketplace." [1]

LEIs are granted not by the Foundation but by designated issuers. Any legal entity making financial transactions can apply for an LEI, including non-registered entities such as trusts and government bodies. In general, natural persons are not eligible for LEIs [2].

            <description>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) maintain a list of organisations whom are involved in the transfer of 'Official Development Assistance' (ODA) financial flows. This list provides a useful fall-back source of identification for government agencies and multilateral organisations involved in aid, and in some cases, for international NGOs. 

The list is updated perioidically in response to demand for new entries from DAC members. 

Users should note that this list is designed to identify both organisations *and* funds or programmes, and so not all entries in this list equate to legally registered organisations. 

The list is available as a spreadsheet containing multiple codelists. Two can be used to construct organisation identifiers.

* The **Agency** list is used to construct identifiers for aid donor and recipient government agencies. This is constructed by combining the **donorcode** and **AgencyCode**, separated with a dash. For example, XM-DAC-1-8 identifies the Austrian (1) Development Agency (8).
 
* The **Channel codes** list is used to construct identifiers for multilateral organisations, and international NGOs for whom no other identifier is available. The 'Channel ID' should be used. For example, XM-DAC-41301 is the identifier for the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). 

* The **Donor** list contains donor code values referring to the donor country as a whole. To maximise consistency, donor codes should not be used unless a specific agency, government department or fund is not identified for the reporting. In all other cases codes should be published in their 'Agency' form (e.g. XM-DAC-1-8 for Austrian Development Agency, rather than XM-DAC-1). 

Users should also note that some organisations exist in both the 'Channel Codes' and 'Agency' lists. As the Channel Codes list provides a cross-walk, use of the Channel Codes is preferred in these cases.</description>

            <description>OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) is the part of the United Nations Secretariat responsible for bringing together humanitarian actors to ensure a coherent response to emergencies. 

OCHA assigns it's own organisation identifiers to parties involved in funding or delivery of humanitarian work, which are used in UN OCHA data, and may be used by some third-parties.

Previously OCHA used identifiers from its Financial Tracking System (FTS) list. It has now changed and uses identifiers from its Humanitarian Programme Cycle (HPC) list. 

Organisations may have different identifiers on the two lists. For example, if an organisation has a legacy code of XM-OCHA-FTS3524 then it does NOT automatically have a new code of XM-OCHA-HPC3524.The deprecated list may be found at http://fts.unocha.org/api/v1/organization.xml although this should only be used for checking historic data and there is no guarantee that it will remain accessible in the future.</description>

            <description>The European Union's Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) provides codes for territorial areas at a number of different levels.

Where no primary identifiers for regional and local government entities are available, then NUTS level 2 and 3 codes, and Local Administrative Unit (LAU 1 and LAU 2 level) codes could be used as a proxy for the primary local government body responsible for that area. 

EuroStat currently maintain a cross-walk between different levels, codes and area names for each jurisdiction. 

To construct an identifier:

For NUTS 2 and 3 codes, use the prefix (XR-NUTS-) and then the NUTS code provided.

For LAU1 and 2 codes (Local authority/ward), use the prefix (XR-NUTS-), the country prefix and underscore (e.g. UK_) , and then the LAU_NAT_Code provided (e.g. E05004874)

For example: XR-NUTS-UK_E07000105

            <description>The Corporate Income Tax (CIT) is a tax imposed on companies resident in the Republic of South Africa.

The South African Revenue Service (SARS) is South Africa&#8217;s tax collecting authority responsible for issuing CIT numbers [1]. Businesses can receive multiple tax numbers from SARS such as CIT, VAT, PAYE etc., however CIT is the preferred identifier to be used. [2] Businesses that receive CIT numbers include public and private companies, co-operatives, universities, trusts, governments and embassies.

            <description>The Nonprofit Organisation Directorate is held under the South African Department of Social Development. NPOs register with the Nonprofit Organisation Directorate and are assigned a registration number. Users can refer to ZA-NPO for unique identifiers for NGOs in South Africa. The database can be searched for free.

Users should note that they should not include "NPO" to the end of the identifier.

"The Nonprofit Organisations Directorate was established in terms of the Nonprofit Organisations Act 71 of 1997 to essentially administer the Register of Nonprofit Organisations in South Africa.  

The Register of Nonprofit Organisations (NPOs) is a voluntary registration facility that enhances the credibility of the registered NPO as it reports to a public office. The NPO Directorate, as a public office, holds information about registered NPOs for the public to access. " [1]

            <description>Non-profit organisations (NPOs) can apply for Public Benefit Organisation (PBO) status from the South Africa Revenue Service in order to become tax exempt. However, not all NPOs will be awarded this status, therefore the ZA-PBO should not be referred to as the Primary list of unique identifiers for NPOs in South Africa.

No searchable database of PBOs has been found.

"The mere fact that an organisation has a non-profit motive or is established or registered as an NPO registered under the NPO Act, or is established as an NPC, does not mean that it automatically qualifies for preferential tax treatment or approval as a PBO.

An organisation will enjoy preferential tax treatment only after it has applied for and been granted approval as a PBO by the Commissioner, and continues to comply with the relevant prescribed requirements. " [1]
