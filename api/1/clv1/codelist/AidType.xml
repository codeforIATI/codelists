    <name>General budget support</name>
    <language>en</language>
    <description>Unearmarked contributions to the government budget including funding to support the implementation of macroeconomic reforms (structural adjustment programmes, poverty reduction strategies). Budget support is a method of financing a recipient country&#8217;s budget through a transfer of resources from an external financing agency to the recipient government&#8217;s national treasury. The funds thus transferred are managed in accordance with the recipient&#8217;s budgetary procedures. Funds transferred to the national treasury for financing programmes or projects managed according to different budgetary procedures from those of the recipient country, with the intention of earmarking the resources for specific uses, are therefore excluded.</description>

    <name>Sector budget support</name>
    <language>en</language>
    <description>Sector budget support, like general budget support, is a financial contribution to a recipient government&#8217;s budget.  However, in sector budget support, the dialogue between donors and partner governments focuses on sector-specific concerns, rather than on overall policy and budget priorities.</description>

    <language>en</language>
    <description>Funds are paid over to NGOs (local, national and international) for use at the latter&#8217;s discretion, and contribute to programmes and activities which NGOs have developed themselves, and which they implement on their own authority and responsibility. Core contributions to PPPs, funds paid over to foundations (e.g. philanthropic foundations), and contributions to research institutes (public and private) are also recorded here. Annex 2 of the DAC Directives provides a list of INGOs, PPPs and networks core contributions to which may be reported under B01. This list is not exclusive.</description>

    <category-description>For contributions under this category, the donor relinquishes the exclusive control of its funds by sharing the responsibility with other stakeholders (other donors, NGOs, multilateral institutions, Public Private Partnerships or PSI vehicles).

    <name>Core contributions to multilateral institutions and global funds</name>
    <language>en</language>
    <description>These funds are classified as multilateral (all other categories are bilateral). The recipient multilateral institution pools contributions so that they lose their identity and become an integral part of its financial assets or liabilities. Also includes Financial Intermediary Funds (GEF, CIFs) for which the World Bank is the Trustee, as well as some UN inter-agency pooled funds, such as CERF and the UN Peacebuilding Fund. See Annex 2 of the Reporting Directives for a comprehensive list of agencies, core contributions to which may be reported under B02 and its subcategories. (Section I. Multilateral institutions). Nota bene: contributions to multilateral development organisations beyond Annex 2 are not reportable in the DAC statistics. The non-ODA components of core support to multilateral organisations included in Annex 2 are not reportable either.</description>

    <name>Project-type interventions</name>
    <language>en</language>
    <description>A project is a set of inputs, activities and outputs, agreed with the partner country*, to reach specific objectives/outcomes within a defined time frame, with a defined budget and a  defined geographical area. Projects can vary significantly in terms of objectives, complexity, amounts involved and duration. There are smaller projects that might involve modest financial resources and last only a few months, whereas large projects might involve more significant amounts, entail successive phases and last for many years. A large project with a number of different components is sometimes referred to as a programme, but should nevertheless be recorded here. Feasibility studies, appraisals and evaluations are included (when designed as part of projects/programmes or dedicated funding arrangements). Monitoring, auditing and situation analyses of projects and programmes are also included. Academic studies, research and development, trainings, scholarships, and other technical assistance activities not directly linked to development projects/programmes should instead be recorded under D02. Aid channelled through NGOs or multilaterals is also recorded here. This includes payments for NGOs and multilaterals to implement donors&#8217; projects and programmes, and funding of specified NGOs projects. By contrast, core funding of NGOs and multilaterals as well as contributions to specific-purpose funds are recorded under B.* In the cases of equity investments, humanitarian aid or aid channelled through NGOs, projects are recorded here even if there was no direct agreement between the donor and the partner country. Contributions to single-donor trust funds and contributions to trust funds earmarked for a specific funding window and/or country are recorded under B033.</description>
