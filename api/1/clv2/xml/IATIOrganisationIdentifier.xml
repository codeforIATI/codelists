        <name xml:lang="fr">Identifiant d'organisation de l'IITA</name>
        <description>This is a list of organisation identifiers that is maintained by the IATI Secretariat.
The prefix for organisations on this list is XI-IATI

If a bona fide organisation is not registered with any recognised or appropriate registration agency (http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/OrganisationRegistrationAgency/) they should contact the IATI Technical Team who will exceptionally allocate an organisation identifier using the XI-IATI prefix.

While some of these identifiers have been derived from DAC codes, this 'meaning' is not carried forward. i.e. IATI generated identifiers have no intrinsic meaning.

For general guidance about constructing Organisation Identifiers, please see http://iatistandard.org/organisation-identifiers/</description>

            <description>The UN pooled funds are a UN inter-agency financing mechanism with three characteristics. First, UN pooled funds are designed to support a clearly defined programmatic purpose and results framework through contributions that are co-mingled, not earmarked to a specific UN entity and held by a UN fund administrator. Second, decisions on project / programmatic allocations are made by a UN-led governance mechanism, taking into account the programmatic purpose and results framework of the fund. Third, fund implementation is (fully or largely) entrusted to UN entities that assume the programmatic and financial accountability for the resources received.</description>

            <description>A trust fund (TF) is a financing arrangement established with contributions from one or more external development partner(s)/partners, and in some cases, from the World Bank Group, to support development-related activities. The World Bank acts as a trustee/administrator for development partners (donors) funds and implements the activities financed through trust funds in accordance with the signed agreements with donors. As part of fiduciary obligations, the World Bank as Trustee/administrator of trust funds maintains the records for trust funds activities distinct and separate from the activities of IBRD and IDA. The Bank also provides periodic report on the financial situation and results of the individual trust funds to donors.</description>
